I am an experienced data analyst with a deep understanding of Python and the use of various data analysis libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. I proficiently present my work results in Jupyter Notebook.

In my work, I also utilize Tableau and Power BI for creating visualizations and dashboards, which allows me to easily present and share data with others.

I am accustomed to collaborating on projects through Jupyter Hub, using Git for teamwork. Additionally, I have experience working on remote servers via the command line, making my work efficient in any conditions.

My proficiency in ClickHouse and PostgreSQL enables me to handle complex queries and effectively work with databases.

I have experience in conducting A/B testing and analyzing the results, which helps me make informed decisions about the best product version.

I have theoretical knowledge of probabilities and experience conducting statistical tests. Moreover, I possess methods for predicting prices based on linear models and bootstrap analysis.

I have a strong understanding of how product managers think and appreciate the value that an analyst brings to the business. I am capable of calculating key product metrics and applying them to solve analytical tasks.
